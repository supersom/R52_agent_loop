Write a minimal ARM assembly program (bare-metal) that calculates the 5th Fibonacci number (which is 5). Add 48 to the result to make it the ASCII character '5'. Then, write the exact string '{expected_output}\n' byte-by-byte to memory address {uart_addr}, which is the UART0 data register on the {board_name} board. Finally, use an ARM semihosting SYS_EXIT call to halt the processor, or cleanly return so the simulator does not hang. Provide ONLY the assembly code.
