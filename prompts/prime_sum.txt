Write a minimal ARM assembly program (bare-metal) that calculates the sum of the first 10 prime numbers. Convert the final sum into its ASCII string representation. Then, write that exact string (e.g. '{expected_output}\n') byte-by-byte to memory address {uart_addr}, which is the UART0 data register on the {board_name} board. Finally, use an ARM semihosting SYS_EXIT call to halt the processor, or cleanly return so the simulator does not hang. Provide ONLY the assembly code.
